Performance Benchmarks
---------------------
This analysis documents performance improvements achieved through optimization.

Methodology:
- Each query was run 5 times in succession
- Results were averaged to account for caching effects
- Tests performed on dataset with 10M transactions, 100K products, and 50K geography records
